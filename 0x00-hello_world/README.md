# 0x00-hello_world
This project done at Holberton school San Francisco, demonstrates my basic ability to write c text files that can be compiled with a corresponding main file and run.

### Prerequisites

BASH shell is needed to execute these scripts.

## Installation & Use

To use the bash scripts and C files:

0. Open up terminal
1. Clone this repository
2. Move into the directory which was just cloned
3. type "./" then the name of the file you want to run
4. hit enter key

for C files:
0. gcc <filename.c>
1. ./a.out

ex. typing ./1-hello_you and hitting enter will execute the file in BASH. This file uses the echo command and environmental variable $USER to say hello to the current user.
## Creation

These scripts were written in EMACS within ubuntu.
